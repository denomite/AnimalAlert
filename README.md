# AnimalAlert

This Arduino project demonstrates how to use the Modulino library with an Arduino Uno R4 Wifi board to:

- Measure distance using a distance sensor
- Trigger a buzzer tone when an object is detected
- Light up 8 NeoPixel LEDs with colors that change based on how close the object is

## Behavior

- **Red** -> Object is **very close**
- **Yellow -> Object is **moderately close**
- **Green** -> Object is **far**
